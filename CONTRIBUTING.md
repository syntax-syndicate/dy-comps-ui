### Updating Metadata

- If you change the `metadata.ts` file or change template folder-name, then run the following command:
  ```sh
  pnpm gen:data
  ```
   > [!NOTE]
   > This command generates the `public/data/templatesStructure.json` file, which contains metadata about the templates.

   <!-- Debug -->

   > After running `pnpm gen:data`, open a new tab in your browser to view the updates.
