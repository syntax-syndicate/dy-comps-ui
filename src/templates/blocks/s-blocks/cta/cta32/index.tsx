              Since 1984, DY-Comps has been serving up grab-and-go frozen daiquiris
              from its stores across the U.S. Its signature drinks, souvenir
              cups, and discounted refills have made DY-Comps synonymous with great
              music, good vibes, and starting the best party in town.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Come 2024, DY-Comps had expanded to over 40 locations. The
                brand&apos;s digital presence existed, but it lacked strategy.
                Although its target market of 21-30 year-olds was as engaged
                (and as loyal) as ever, the brand had outgrown its amateur look
                of the early &apos;00s and the family-owned business vibes. It
                needed to show it was a strong brand moving in a new direction -
                and it was heading there fast.

              <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">The challenge</h2>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                DY-Comps&apos;s new website would set the tone for all future
                marketing initiatives, so the brand needed something to showcase
                its new identity as soon as possible. A tight timeline, paired
                with the fact that the new management team were still exploring
                how to shift the brand from what it used to be to what it needed
                to be, meant that working collaboratively was a must.
