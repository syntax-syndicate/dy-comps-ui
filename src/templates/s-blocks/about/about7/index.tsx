              Since 2015, BlockParty has been revolutionizing the way
              communities come together to celebrate. Our innovative block party
              planning platform, festive decoration kits, and neighborhood
              engagement tools have made BlockParty synonymous with
              unforgettable street festivals, strengthened community bonds, and
              creating the best local celebrations in town.

                By 2023, BlockParty had facilitated over 5,000 neighborhood
                celebrations across the country. While our reputation for
                bringing communities together was strong, our digital presence
                needed a refresh. Although our target market of community-minded
                individuals aged 25-45 was as engaged (and as enthusiastic) as
                ever, we had outgrown our simple website and basic social media
                approach.

              <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">The challenge</h2>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                BlockParty&apos;s new website would set the foundation for all
                future community engagement initiatives, so we needed a platform
                that could showcase our expanded services and vision as soon as
                possible. A tight timeline, coupled with our commitment to
                representing the diverse communities we serve, meant that
                collaborative input from our network of local organizers was
                crucial.
